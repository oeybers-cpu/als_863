<h3>Language as a Social Practice</h3>
<p>A sociocultural framework for discourse analysis views language not as an abstract system of rules, but as a social practice. This means that language is always situated in a particular social and cultural context, and it is through our use of language that we create and maintain our social world. From this perspective, the meaning of an utterance is not inherent in the words themselves, but is constructed in the interaction between people. It is what people do with language that matters.</p>

<h4>The Interplay of Language, Culture, and Society</h4>
<p>This framework emphasizes the inseparability of language, culture, and society. Our language is shaped by our culture, and our culture is expressed through our language. For example, the way we greet each other, the way we tell stories, and the way we argue are all influenced by our cultural background. At the same time, our use of language reinforces and reproduces our cultural norms and values. Society, in turn, is the broader context in which language and culture are enacted. It is the system of social institutions, power relations, and ideologies that shapes our lives.</p>

<h4>Power and Ideology in Discourse</h4>
<p>A key focus of a sociocultural approach to discourse analysis is the relationship between discourse, power, and ideology. Discourses are not neutral; they are always infused with power relations and ideological assumptions. Some Discourses are more powerful than others, and they can be used to include or exclude people from social groups and institutions. For example, the dominant academic Discourse in a university can be a barrier for students from non-traditional backgrounds. Ideology refers to the systems of beliefs and values that are often taken for granted in a society. Discourse is a primary means by which ideologies are produced and reproduced. By analyzing discourse, we can uncover the hidden ideologies that shape our thinking and our social world.</p>
