<h3>What is Discourse Analysis?</h3>
<p>Discourse analysis is the study of language in use, whether in the form of text or talk. It goes beyond the sentence level to understand how language is used in real-life contexts to achieve social purposes. Rather than focusing on the formal structure of language, discourse analysis examines how people use language to do things, to be certain kinds of people, and to make sense of the world and their experiences in it.</p>

<h3>A Sociocultural Linguistic Framework</h3>
<p>Within a sociocultural linguistic framework, discourse analysis is not just about language itself, but about the interplay between language, culture, and society. This perspective, heavily influenced by the work of scholars like James Paul Gee, emphasizes that language is a social practice. It is through our use of language that we enact social identities, build relationships, and participate in social and cultural groups. This approach moves away from viewing language as a neutral tool for communication and instead sees it as a powerful force that shapes our social world.</p>
