<h3>Discourse Analysis in the Classroom</h3>
<p>Discourse analysis has numerous practical applications for teachers. By understanding the different Discourses that students bring to the classroom, teachers can create more inclusive and effective learning environments. It provides a framework for understanding the linguistic and cultural diversity of students and for helping them to navigate the academic Discourse of school.</p>

<h4>Understanding Student Diversity</h4>
<p>Every student comes to the classroom with their own Primary Discourse, which is shaped by their family, community, and cultural background. This means that students may have different ways of using language, telling stories, and interacting with others. For example, some students may come from cultures that value indirect communication, while others may be more direct. By being aware of these differences, teachers can avoid misinterpreting students' behavior and can create a classroom culture that values all students' voices.</p>

<h4>Navigating Academic Discourse</h4>
<p>The academic Discourse of school is a Secondary Discourse that all students must learn to be successful. This Discourse has its own specific ways of using language, thinking, and arguing. For example, academic writing is typically objective, analytical, and evidence-based. For students whose Primary Discourse is very different from the academic Discourse, this can be a significant challenge. Teachers can use discourse analysis to explicitly teach the conventions of academic Discourse and to help students to become more aware of their own language use.</p>

<h4>Code-Switching in the Classroom</h4>
<p>Code-switching, or the ability to switch between different social languages, is a key skill for all students. Teachers can help students to develop this skill by creating opportunities for them to use different social languages in the classroom. For example, students might use a more informal social language when working in small groups, and a more formal social language when presenting their work to the class. By valuing and making space for students' home languages and dialects, teachers can help students to see themselves as competent and capable language users.</p>
