<h3>The Many Voices We Speak</h3>
<p>Social languages are the different styles of language that we use in different contexts. They are the "varieties of language used in specific social settings". Think about the different ways you talk to your friends, your parents, your teachers, and your boss. You are likely using different social languages in each of these situations. You might use slang and informal language with your friends, but more formal and respectful language with your boss.</p>

<h4>A Key Part of Discourses</h4>
<p>Social languages are a key component of Discourses. Each Discourse has its own characteristic social language. For example, the Discourse of law has a very specific social language that is characterized by complex sentence structures, Latin phrases, and a specialized vocabulary. To be a successful lawyer, you need to be able to speak and write in this social language. Similarly, the Discourse of science has its own social language that is characterized by precise terminology, objective language, and a focus on evidence and data.</p>

<h4>More Than Just Words</h4>
<p>It's important to remember that social languages are not just about the words we use. They also include the way we use our voice (our tone, pitch, and volume), our body language, and the way we structure our communication. For example, a doctor's social language includes not only medical terminology but also a calm and reassuring tone of voice and a professional demeanor.</p>

<h4>Code-Switching</h4>
<p>We are constantly switching between different social languages as we move through different social contexts. This is called "code-switching". For example, a student might use a very academic social language when talking to their professor, but then switch to a more informal social language when talking to their friends in the hallway. The ability to code-switch effectively is a key social and linguistic skill.</p>
